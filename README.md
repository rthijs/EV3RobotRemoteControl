# EV3RobotRemoteControl
Use a hardware controller, like a PS2 or XBox controller, to control Lego EV3 Robots

## The robot
Execute `mainRobot.py` on the robot.

## The server
Execute `robotCommandClient.py`. If there are errors about the game controller use `inputsTest.py` to verify it's working correctly.
